This is a base, based off of one of the example projects in the CTRE HERO VS 2019 extension.

**Specific code for individual robots is within specific branches. This code should NOT be deployed to robots.**

Program.cs is the actual code, everything else is supplemental.
This is designed to work only with VS 2019 and the CTRE HERO board- deploying this to something such as a roboRIO will not work.
